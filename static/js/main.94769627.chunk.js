With self-driving cars, increasingly automated manufacturing lines, and even online customer service Chabot that can answer seemingly any question, jobs that used to be performed by humans are becoming autonomous. Fortunately, most experts agree that this will not lead to mass unemployment, however, we\u2019ll see a more polarized workforce. The idea is that robots and increasingly sophisticated software are poised to replace the jobs held by middle skilled individuals. These jobs include, manufacturers, office clerks, and researchers & data entry. The automation of these middle skilled jobs will make them more efficient, and as a result, there will be an increased demand for high skilled level positions such as managers, technical professionals. These jobs usually require college degrees in order to be qualified. Since these high skilled and high paying jobs are increasing for those with the credentials, there is increased demand for lower skilled jobs such as waiters, retail workers, and entertainment will increase. These is because the high skilled employees will be afforded with more expandable income and time. As a result, two very different classifications are created. The high paying, high skilled jobs at the top, and the low paying, and low skilled jobs at the bottom. This job polarization brings about serious ethical concerns. The most obvious being the huge inequality in wages and opportunity. Those who hold high paying jobs can afford to give their children a higher quality of education, and as a result, those kids go on to fill high paying jobs. On the other end, those who hold low paying jobs cannot afford the same level of education for their children, which puts them at a major disadvantage to attain the high paying jobs. This is the cycle of poverty, which is nothing new. However, by eliminating the middle skilled jobs, it makes it much more difficult to escape poverty. This is even more concerning when considering that the already marginalized minority populations are poised to suffer the most as a result.

Redlining essentially denied minority communities services and funding from local and federal governments. The effects of these practices are still felt today as poverty is far more concentrated in black and Hispanic communities as opposed to white communities. These negative effects are profoundly demonstrated in the inequality of public schools. Because schools are largely funded by local property taxes, the schools in black and hispanic communities receive far less funding than those is white communities.  It\u2019s estimated that predominantly black and Hispanic school districts receive $23 million less than the predominantly white school district despite serving equal amounts of students. The unequal funding of the schools at the elementary and high school levels are then reflected at the collegiate level. The table below describes this well: The table indicates that white and Asian students make up a disproportionately high percentage of the more selective school, with black and Hispanic students being underrepresented at these universities. Thus, the black and Hispanic populations are overrepresented in the less prestigious schools. The image below graphically illustrates the message above."))}}]),a}(i.a.Component),f=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return i.a.createElement("div",{class:"Suggestions-Page"},i.a.createElement(d.a,{fluid:!0},i.a.createElement(u.a,null,i.a.createElement("h1",null,"Suggestions"))),i.a.createElement("p",null,"The biggest suggestion I have to mitigate the negative effects of job polarization, is to fix the educational system. All public schools, regardless of nearby property value, should be given equal funding. This would require restructuring the way schools receive funding from the government. As opposed to having property taxes only serve the scool districts within its borders, the property taxes ought to be pooled across the state. From this large pool of money, each school should be funded accordingly based off the number of students they serve. This would even the educational playing field for children across all communities. Furthermore, colleges must play an active role in recruiting, and maintaining students from minority populations. This can be done by creating scholarships so that these students can attend the top tier college they otherwise could not have afforded. Furthermore, mentorship programs can be created to help keep minority students on pace to graduate. Lastly, the educational system should update its curriculum to better prepare students for the new future of work. This would require giving more focus to coding, analytics, as well as interpersonal skills. However, it is important to note that classes in art, history, and literature and so on should not be undermined. These fields are inherently immune to automation and add cultural value to society. But, if we raise the standard of the typical education level, the higher skilled job market can become saturated, thus lowering the wages and depolarizing the market."))}}]),a}(i.a.Component),b=a(29),y=a(30),v=a(59),w=a.n(v),E=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return i.a.createElement(b.a,{bg:"light",variant:"light",expand:"lg"},i.a.createElement(b.a.Brand,null,i.a.createElement("img",{src:w.a,width:"120",height:"40",className:"d-inline-block align-top"})),i.a.createElement(b.a.Toggle,{"aria-controls":"basic-navbar-nav"}),i.a.createElement(b.a.Collapse,{id:"basic-navbar-nav"},i.a.createElement(y.a,{className:"mr-auto"},i.a.createElement(y.a.Link,{href:"/research-website2"},"Home"),i.a.createElement(y.a.Link,{href:"/research-website2/#/minorities"},"Systemic Racism & Education"),i.a.createElement(y.a.Link,{href:"/research-website2/#/suggestions"},"Suggestions"))))}}]),a}(i.a.Component),k=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return i.a.createElement(m.e,{color:"red",className:"font-small pt-4 mt-4 "},i.a.createElement(m.d,{fluid:!0,className:"text-center text-md-left"},i.a.createElement(m.j,null,i.a.createElement(m.c,null,i.a.createElement("h5",{className:"title"},"Brendan Hehir"),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Advanced Writting in the Technical Professions")),i.a.createElement(m.c,null,i.a.createElement("h5",{className:"title"},"Contact"),i.a.createElement("ul",null,i.a.createElement("p",null,"hehir.b@northeastern.edu"))))),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"footer-copyright text-center py-3"},i.a.createElement(m.d,{fluid:!0},"\xa9 ",(new Date).getFullYear()," Copyright")))}}]),a}(i.a.Component),j=a(25),T=a(7);var O=function(){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},i.a.createElement(E,null),i.a.createElement(j.a,{basename:"/"},i.a.createElement(T.c,null,i.a.createElement(T.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:p}),i.a.createElement(T.a,{path:"/minorities",component:g}),i.a.createElement(T.a,{path:"/suggestions",component:f}))),i.a.createElement(k,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));a(100);s.a.render(i.a.createElement(i.a.StrictMode,null,i.a.createElement(O,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))},37:function(e,t,a){},45:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Brendan_web.380246f3.png"},59:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Northeastern_University_Logo_full.0776fbb2.png"},64:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(101)},69:function(e,t,a){},70:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/logo.ee7cd8ed.svg"},71:function(e,t,a){}},[[64,1,2]]]);
