With self-driving cars, increasingly automated manufacturing lines, and even online customer service Chatbot that can answer seemingly any question, jobs that used to be performed by humans are becoming autonomous. Fortunately, most experts agree that this will not lead to mass unemployment, however, we\u2019ll see a more polarized workforce. The idea is that robots and increasingly sophisticated software are poised to replace the jobs held by middle skilled individuals. These jobs include, manufacturers, office clerks, and researchers & data entry. The automation of these middle skilled jobs will make them more efficient, and as a result, there will be an increased demand for high skilled level positions such as managers, technical professionals. These jobs usually require college degrees in order to be qualified. Since these high skilled and high paying jobs are increasing for those with the credentials, there is increased demand for lower skilled jobs such as waiters, retail workers, and entertainment will increase. These is because the high skilled employees will be afforded with more expandable income and time. As a result, two very different classifications are created. The high paying, high skilled jobs at the top, and the low paying, and low skilled jobs at the bottom. This job polarization brings about serious ethical concerns. The most obvious being the huge inequality in wages and opportunity. Those who hold high paying jobs can afford to give their children a higher quality of education, and as a result, those kids go on to fill high paying jobs. On the other end, those who hold low paying jobs cannot afford the same level of education for their children, which puts them at a major disadvantage to attain the high paying jobs. This is the cycle of poverty, which is nothing new. However, by eliminating the middle skilled jobs, it makes it much more difficult to escape poverty. This is even more concerning when considering that the already marginalized minority populations are poised to suffer the most as a result.")),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement(d.a,{pill:!0,variant:"danger"},"Navigate through the tabs to learn more.")," "),l.a.createElement(f.Parallax,{className:"custom-class",y:[-3,3],tagOuter:"figure"},l.a.createElement(v.a,{className:"robot",src:b.a}))))}}]),a}(l.a.Component),E=a(71),w=a.n(E),k=a(72),j=a.n(k),O=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(){return Object(o.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(s.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return l.a.createElement("div",{class:"Minority-Page"},l.a.createElement(h.a,{fluid:!0},l.a.createElement(m.a,null,l.a.createElement("h1",null,"Systemic Racism & Education"))),l.a.createElement("div",{className:"main-text"},l.a.createElement("p",{className:"left"}," ","The root cause of the unfair disadvantage held by black and hispanic populations goes back centuries, however, the modern day socio-economic disadvantage can be accredited to the redlining practices of the 1930s. Redlining essentially denied minority communities services and funding from local and federal governments. The effects of these practices are still felt today as poverty is far more concentrated in black and Hispanic communities as opposed to white communities. These negative effects are profoundly demonstrated in the inequality of public schools. Because schools are largely funded by local property taxes, the schools in black and hispanic communities receive far less funding than those is white communities. It\u2019s estimated that predominantly black and Hispanic school districts receive $23 million less than the predominantly white school district despite serving equal amounts of students.
