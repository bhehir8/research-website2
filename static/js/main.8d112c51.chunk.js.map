moving closer to a society run by\n                robots. With self-driving cars, increasingly automated\n                manufacturing lines, and even online customer service Chatbot\n                that can answer seemingly any question, jobs that used to be\n                performed by humans are becoming autonomous. Fortunately, most\n                experts agree that this will not lead to mass unemployment,\n                however, we’ll see a more polarized workforce. The idea is that\n                robots and increasingly sophisticated software are poised to\n                replace the jobs held by middle skilled individuals. These jobs\n                include, manufacturers, office clerks, and researchers & data\n                entry. The automation of these middle skilled jobs will make\n                them more efficient, and as a result, there will be an increased\n                demand for high skilled level positions such as managers,\n                technical professionals. These jobs usually require college\n                degrees in order to be qualified. Since these high skilled and\n                high paying jobs are increasing for those with the credentials,\n                there is increased demand for lower skilled jobs such as\n                waiters, retail workers, and entertainment will increase. These\n                is because the high skilled employees will be afforded with more\n                expandable income and time. As a result, two very different\n                classifications are created. The high paying, high skilled jobs\n                at the top, and the low paying, and low skilled jobs at the\n                bottom. This job polarization brings about serious ethical\n                concerns. The most obvious being the huge inequality in wages\n                and opportunity. Those who hold high paying jobs can afford to\n                give their children a higher quality of education, and as a\n                result, those kids go on to fill high paying jobs. On the other\n                end, those who hold low paying jobs cannot afford the same level\n                of education for their children, which puts them at a major\n                disadvantage to attain the high paying jobs. This is the cycle\n                of poverty, which is nothing new. However, by eliminating the\n                middle skilled jobs, it makes it much more difficult to escape\n                poverty. This is even more concerning when considering that the\n                already marginalized minority populations are poised to suffer\n                the most as a result.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <Badge pill variant=\"danger\">\n              Navigate through the tabs to learn more.\n            </Badge>{\" \"}\n          </div>\n\n          <Parallax className=\"custom-class\" y={[-3, 3]} tagOuter=\"figure\">\n            <Image className=\"robot\" src={robot} />\n          </Parallax>\n        </main>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../custom.scss\";\nimport \"mdbreact/dist/css/mdb.css\";\nimport Jumbotron from \"react-bootstrap/Jumbotron\";\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\nimport { MDBCol, MDBContainer, MDBRow, MDBFooter } from \"mdbreact\";\nimport Image from \"react-bootstrap/Image\";\nimport table from \"../Table.PNG\";\nimport school_split from \"../School_split_graphic.PNG\";\n\nexport default class Minorities extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div class=\"Minority-Page\">\n        {/* <strong className=\"title\">The Ethical Dilemma of Automation\nReplacing the Workforce</strong> */}\n        <Jumbotron fluid>\n          <Container>\n            <h1>Systemic Racism & Education</h1>\n          </Container>\n        </Jumbotron>\n        <div className=\"main-text\">\n          <p className=\"left\">\n            {\" \"}\n            The root cause of the unfair disadvantage held by black and hispanic\n            populations goes back centuries, however, the modern day\n            socio-economic disadvantage can be accredited to the redlining\n            practices of the 1930s. Redlining essentially denied minority\n            communities services and funding from local and federal governments.\n            The effects of these practices are still felt today as poverty is\n            far more concentrated in black and Hispanic communities as opposed\n            to white communities. These negative effects are profoundly\n            demonstrated in the inequality of public schools. Because schools\n            are largely funded by local property taxes, the schools in black and\n            hispanic communities receive far less funding than those is white\n            communities. It’s estimated that predominantly black and Hispanic\n            school districts receive $23 million less than the predominantly\n            white school district despite serving equal amounts of students. The\n            unequal funding of the schools at the elementary and high school\n            levels are then reflected at the collegiate level. The table below\n            describes this well:{\" \"}\n          </p>{\" \"}\n          <br />\n        </div>\n\n        <Image src={table} />\n\n        <div className=\"main-text\">\n          <p className=\"left\">\n            The table indicates that white and Asian students make up a\n            disproportionately high percentage of the more selective school,\n            with black and Hispanic students being underrepresented at these\n            universities. Thus, the black and Hispanic populations are\n            overrepresented in the less prestigious schools.

I’ve outlines 3 tips to do so below.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"left\">\n            <ol type=\"1\">\n              <li>\n                <strong>Fix School Funding Disparities</strong>\n              </li>\n              <p className=\"left\">\n                All public schools, regardless of nearby property value, should\n                be given equal funding. This would require restructuring the way\n                schools receive funding from the government. As opposed to\n                having property taxes only serve the school districts within its\n                borders, the property taxes ought to be pooled across the state.\n                From this large pool of money, each school should be funded\n                accordingly based off the number of students they serve. This\n                would even the educational playing field for children across all\n                communities.\n              </p>\n              <li>\n                <strong>Hold Higher Education Accountable</strong>\n              </li>\n              <p>\n                Colleges must play an active role in recruiting, and maintaining\n                students from minority populations. This can be done by creating\n                scholarships so that these students can attend the top tier\n                college they otherwise could not have afforded. Furthermore,\n                mentorship programs can be created to help keep minority\n                students on pace to graduate.\n              </p>\n              <li>\n                <strong>Update the Curriculum</strong>\n              </li>\n              <p>\n                Lastly, the educational system should update its curriculum to\n                better prepare students for the new future of work. This would\n                require giving more focus to coding, analytics, as well as\n                interpersonal skills. However, it is important to note that\n                classes in art, history, and literature and so on should not be\n                undermined. These fields are inherently immune to automation and\n                add cultural value to society. But, if we raise the standard of\n                the typical education level, the higher skilled job market can\n                become saturated, thus lowering the wages and depolarizing the\n                market.\n              </p>\n            </ol>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Navbar from \"react-bootstrap/Navbar\";\nimport Nav from \"react-bootstrap/Nav\";\nimport Button from \"react-bootstrap/Button\";\nimport Form from \"react-bootstrap/Form\";\nimport FormControl from \"react-bootstrap/Form\";\nimport logo from \"../Northeastern_University_Logo_full.png\";\n\nexport default class HomePage extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Navbar bg=\"light\" variant=\"light\" expand=\"lg\">\n        <Navbar.Brand>\n          <img\n            src={logo}\n            width=\"120\"\n            height=\"40\"\n            className=\"d-inline-block align-top\"\n          />\n        </Navbar.Brand>\n        <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=\"basic-navbar-nav\" />\n        <Navbar.Collapse id=\"basic-navbar-nav\">\n          <Nav className=\"mr-auto\">\n            <Nav.Link href=\"/research-website2\">Home</Nav.Link>\n            <Nav.Link href=\"/research-website2/#/minorities\">\n              Systemic Racism & Education\n            </Nav.Link>\n            {/* <NavDropdown title=\"Dropdown\" id=\"basic-nav-dropdown\">\n            <NavDropdown.Item href=\"#action/3.1\">Action</NavDropdown.Item>\n            <NavDropdown.Item href=\"#action/3.2\">Another action</NavDropdown.Item>\n            <NavDropdown.Item href=\"#action/3.3\">Something</NavDropdown.Item>\n            <NavDropdown.Divider />\n            <NavDropdown.Item href=\"#action/3.4\">Separated link</NavDropdown.Item>\n        </NavDropdown> */}\n            <Nav.Link href=\"/research-website2/#/suggestions\">\n              Suggestions\n            </Nav.Link>\n            <Nav.Link href=\"/research-website2/#/sources\">Sources</Nav.Link>\n          </Nav>\n        </Navbar.Collapse>\n      </Navbar>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import { MDBCol, MDBContainer, MDBRow, MDBFooter } from \"mdbreact\";\nimport brendan from \"../Brendan_web.png\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default class Footer extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MDBFooter color=\"red\" className=\"font-small pt-4 mt-4\">\n        <MDBContainer fluid className=\"text-center text-md-left\">\n          <MDBRow>\n            <MDBCol>\n              <h5 className=\"title\">Brendan Hehir</h5>\n              <p>Advanced Writting in the Technical Professions</p>\n            </MDBCol>\n            <MDBCol>\n              <h5 className=\"title\">Contact</h5>\n              <ul>\n                {/* <li className=\"list-unstyled\"> */}\n                <p>hehir.b@northeastern.edu</p>\n                {/* </li> */}\n              </ul>\n            </MDBCol>\n          </MDBRow>\n        </MDBContainer>\n        <div className=\"footer-copyright text-center py-3\">\n          <MDBContainer fluid>\n            &copy; {new Date().getFullYear()} Copyright\n          </MDBContainer>\n        </div>\n      </MDBFooter>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../custom.scss\";\nimport \"mdbreact/dist/css/mdb.css\";\nimport Jumbotron from \"react-bootstrap/Jumbotron\";\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\nimport { MDBCol, MDBContainer, MDBRow, MDBFooter } from \"mdbreact\";\n\nexport default class Suggestions extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div class=\"Sources-Page\">\n        {/* <strong className=\"title\">The Ethical Dilemma of Automation\nReplacing the Workforce</strong> */}\n        <Jumbotron fluid>\n          <Container>\n            <h1>Sources</h1>\n          </Container>\n        </Jumbotron>\n        <div className=\"main-text\">\n          <p className=\"left\">\r\nM.
