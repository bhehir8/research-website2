Fortunately, most experts agree that this will not lead to mass unemployment. However, we\u2019ll see a more polarized workforce. The idea is that robots and increasingly sophisticated software are poised to replace the jobs held by middle skilled individuals. Middle skilled jobs include manufacturers, office clerks, and researchers. The automation of these middle skilled jobs will make them more efficient, and as a result, there will be an increased demand for high skilled level positions such as managers and technical professionals. High skilled jobs usually require college degrees in order to be qualified. Since these high skilled and high paying jobs are increasing for those with the credentials, there is increased demand for lower skilled jobs such as waiters, retail workers, and entertainers. This is because the high skilled employees will be afforded with more expandable income and time. As a result, two very different classifications are created.

On the other end, those who hold low paying jobs cannot afford the same level of education for their children, which puts them at a major disadvantage to attain the high paying jobs.

The effects of these practices are still felt today as poverty is far more concentrated in Black and Hispanic communities as opposed to white communities.
