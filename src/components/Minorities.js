<p> The root cause of the unfair disadvantage held by black and hispanic populations goes back centuries, however, the modern day socio-economic disadvantage can be accredited to the redlining practices of the 1930s. Redlining essentially denied minority communities services and funding from local and federal governments. The effects of these practices are still felt today as poverty is far more concentrated in black and Hispanic communities as opposed to white communities. These negative effects are profoundly demonstrated in the inequality of public schools. Because schools are largely funded by local property taxes, the schools in black and hispanic communities receive far less funding than those is white communities.  Itâ€™s estimated that predominantly black and Hispanic school districts receive $23 million less than the predominantly white school district despite serving equal amounts of students.
The unequal funding of the schools at the elementary and high school levels are then reflected at the collegiate level. The table below describes this well:

The table indicates that white and Asian students make up a disproportionately high percentage of the more selective school, with black and Hispanic students being underrepresented at these universities. Thus, the black and Hispanic populations are overrepresented in the less prestigious schools. The image below graphically illustrates the message above.
