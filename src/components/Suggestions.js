The biggest suggestion I have to mitigate the negative effects of job polarization, is to fix the educational system. All public schools, regardless of nearby property value, should be given equal funding. This would require restructuring the way schools receive funding from the government. As opposed to having property taxes only serve the scool districts within its borders, the property taxes ought to be pooled across the state. From this large pool of money, each school should be funded accordingly based off the number of students they serve. This would even the educational playing field for children across all communities. 
Furthermore, colleges must play an active role in recruiting, and maintaining students from minority populations. This can be done by creating scholarships so that these students can attend the top tier college they otherwise could not have afforded. Furthermore, mentorship programs can be created to help keep minority students on pace to graduate.
Lastly, the educational system should update its curriculum to better prepare students for the new future of work. This would require giving more focus to coding, analytics, as well as interpersonal skills. However, it is important to note that classes in art, history, and literature and so on should not be undermined. These fields are inherently immune to automation and add cultural value to society. But, if we raise the standard of the typical education level, the higher skilled job market can become saturated, thus lowering the wages and depolarizing the market.
